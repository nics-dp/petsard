```yaml
field_combinations:
  -
    - education: income        # Define field mapping: education (source) -> income (target)
    -
        Doctorate:             # When education is Doctorate
          - '>50K'             # income can only be '>50K'
        Masters:               # When education is Masters
          - '>50K'             # income can be '>50K'
          - '<=50K'            # or '<=50K'
```

**Allowlist Effect Example**:

Given rule:
```yaml
field_combinations:
  -
    - education: income
    - Doctorate:
        - '>50K'
```

| education | income | Result |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Doctorate | >50K | ✅ Keep (matches rule) |
| Doctorate | <=50K | ❌ Filter (violates rule) |
| Masters | >50K | ➖ Unaffected (rule not applicable) |
| Masters | <=50K | ➖ Unaffected (rule not applicable) |
| Bachelor | >50K | ➖ Unaffected (rule not applicable) |
| Bachelor | <=50K | ➖ Unaffected (rule not applicable) |

**Important**: Only affects explicitly specified value combinations (Doctorate), all other combinations are retained.

## Syntax Format

Field combination constraints allow you to define value domain relationships between different fields, ensuring that field combinations in synthetic data conform to real-world logical specifications.

### Supported Combination Types

- **Single Field Mapping**: Constraints based on a single field's value
- **Multi-Field Mapping**: More complex constraints considering multiple fields' values simultaneously

### Allowlist Mechanism Explanation

Based on the above example (`education` → `income`):
- **Constrained values**:
  - When `education = 'Doctorate'`, `income` can only be `'>50K'`
  - When `education = 'Masters'`, `income` can be `'>50K'` or `'<=50K'`
- **Unconstrained values**:
  - `income` for other `education` values like `'Bachelors'`, `'HS-grad'` etc. are not restricted
  - Data with education other than Doctorate and Masters are always retained, regardless of their `income` value

**Implementation Limitations**: In the current implementation, field combination constraints use an allowlist approach and only support explicitly listed value combinations. Numeric fields can be enumerated for valid values, but logical comparisons using comparison operators (`>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`) like in field constraints are not yet supported.

### Single Field Mapping Syntax

```yaml
-
  - source_field_name: target_field_name
  -
      source_value1:
        - target_value1
        - target_value2
      source_value2:
        - target_value3
```

---

### Multi-Field Mapping Syntax

```yaml
-
  -
    - source_field_name1
    - source_field_name2
  : target_field_name
  -
    - source_value1
    - source_value2
  :
    - target_value1
    - target_value2
```

## Important Notes

- Uses **allowlist** approach: only checks explicitly listed value combinations
- Null values (NA) are not affected by rules
- String values require exact matching (case-sensitive)
- Target values must use list format: `[value]` or `[value1, value2]`
