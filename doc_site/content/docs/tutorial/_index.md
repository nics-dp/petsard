You can run these examples by executing the following code with your YAML config file:

```python
exec = Executor(config=yaml_path)
exec.run()
```

The following scenarios guide you in choosing the right YAML configuration:

1. **YAML Configuration**: [YAML Setup](docs/tutorial/yaml-config)

  - When you need to understand how to configure experiment parameters
  - For managing and organizing complex experiment workflows
  - Control all experiment settings through YAML files

2. **Basic Usage**: [Default Synthesis](docs/tutorial/default-synthesis)

  - When you only need basic data synthesis
  - For simple privacy-enhanced synthetic data generation

3. **Data Constraining**ï¼š[Data Constraining](docs/tutorial/data-constraining)

  - When you need to control synthetic data characteristics
  - Includes field value rules, field combinations, and NA handling
  - Ensure synthetic data meets business logic

4. **Basic Usage with Evaluation**: [Default Synthesis and Evaluation](docs/tutorial/default-synthesis-default-evaluation)

  - When you need both synthesis and comprehensive evaluation
  - Includes protection, fidelity, and utility assessments

5. **Evaluation of External Solutions**: [External Synthesis with Default Evaluation](docs/tutorial/external-synthesis-default-evaluation)

  - When you have pre-synthesized data
  - For evaluating existing privacy-enhanced solutions

6. **Special Scenarios**: [Special Cases](docs/tutorial/special-cases)

  - For specific requirements or exceptions
  - Contains solutions for unique data situations


Simply choose the scenario that matches your needs, prepare the corresponding YAML configuration, and run the code above.
