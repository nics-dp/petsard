# Encoder

The `Encoder` module transforms categorical data into numerical format, a requirement for many modeling procedures. Currently, we provide two encoders: the uniform encoder and the label encoder.

## `Encoder_Uniform`: Uniform Encoder

Applying uniform encoders during data processing, as suggested by [datacebo](https://datacebo.com/blog/improvement-uniform-encoder/), can enhance the performance of generative algorithms compared to other encoders. The concept is straightforward: map each category to a specific range in the uniform distribution, with ranges determined by the relative proportion of each category in the data. Major categories occupy larger areas under the distribution.

Advantages of using a uniform encoder:

1. The variable's distribution converts from discrete to continuous, facilitating modeling.
2. The range of the new distribution is fixed, allowing easy conversion of any value between 0 and 1 to a category.
3. The mapping relationship retains information about the original distribution, a valuable property for sampling. More frequent categories are more likely to be sampled due to their larger areas under the distribution.

A toy example demonstrates the output of a uniform encoder:

Assuming a categorical variable with three categories, 'a', 'b', and 'c', and associated proportions of 1:3:1, respectively. The mapping relationship is as follows:

    {
        'a': [0.0, 0.2),
        'b': [0.2, 0.8),
        'c': [0.8, 1.0]
    }

After transformation by the uniform encoder, data belonging to category 'a' will be assigned a random value between 0.0 (inclusive) and 0.2 (exclusive), data in category 'b' between 0.2 (inclusive) and 0.8 (exclusive), and data in category 'c' between 0.8 (inclusive) and 1.0 (inclusive).

To inverse transform numerical data to categorical data, simply check the range in which the value falls and convert it back to the corresponding category using the mapping relationship.

Uniform encoders are available by calling `Encoder_Uniform`.

```python
from PETsARD.Processor.Encoder import Encoder_Uniform

encoder = Encoder_Uniform()
```

## `Encoder_Label`: Label Encoder

Transform categorical data into numerical data by assigning a series of integers (1, 2, 3,...) to the categories.

```python
from PETsARD.Processor.Encoder import Encoder_Label

encoder = Encoder_Label()
```
