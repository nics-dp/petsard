# Encoder

`Encoder` can transform categorical data into numerical one, which is a requirement for most modelling procedures. At this moment we provide two encoders, uniform encoder and label encoder.

## `Encoder_Uniform`: Uniform Encoder

According to [datacebo](https://datacebo.com/blog/improvement-uniform-encoder/), applying uniform encoders during data processing can boost the performance of the generative algorithm compared to other encoders. The concept is simple: mapping each category to a certain range in the uniform distribution. The ranges are determined by the relative proportion of the category in the data. That is, the major categories occupy more areas under the distribution.

There are some advantages using uniform encoder:

1. The distribution of the variable converts to continuous variable from discrete variable, making it easier for modelling.
2. The range of the new distribution is fixed. That is, all the values between 0 and 1 can be converted to a category.
3. The mapping relationship contains the information of the original distribution, which is a nice property for sampling. When sampling from the distribution, the category appearing frequently is more likely to be sampled because of the larger areas under distribution.

Here we use a toy example to demonstrate what the output of a uniform encoder looks like.

Assuming a categorical variable in a dataset contains 3 categories, 'a', 'b', and 'c', and the associated proportions are 1:3:1, respectively. The mapping relationship can be described as following,

    {
        'a': [0.0, 0.2),
        'b': [0.2, 0.8),
        'c': [0.8, 1.0]
    }

After the transformation of the uniform encoder, all the data belongs to the category 'a' will be assigned as a random value between 0.0 (inclusive) and 0.2 (exclusive); all the data belongs to the category 'b' will be assigned as a random value between 0.2 (inclusive) and 0.8 (exclusive); all the data belongs to the category 'c' will be assigned as a random value between 0.8 (inclusive) and 1.0 (inclusive).

To inverse transform the numerical data to categorical data, it just needs to check the range where the value is in and converts the value back to the corresponding category using the mapping relationship.

Uniform encoders are available by calling `Encoder_Uniform`.

```python
from PETsARD.Processor.Encoder import Encoder_Uniform

encoder = Encoder_Uniform()
```

## `Encoder_Label`: Label Encoder

Transform the categorical data into numerical data by assigning a series of integers (i.e., 1, 2, 3,...) to the categories.

```python
from PETsARD.Processor.Encoder import Encoder_Label

encoder = Encoder_Label()
```
