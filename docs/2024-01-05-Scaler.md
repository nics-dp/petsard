# Scaler

The `Scaler` module is designed to standardise and scale data using various methods. Four scaling methods are provided:

## `Scaler_Standard`: Standardise the data

This method applies `StandardScaler` from the sklearn library, transforming the data to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

```python
from PETsARD.Processor.Scaler import Scaler_Standard

scaler = Scaler_Standard()
```

## `Scaler_ZeroCenter`: Scale the data to have the mean=0

Utilising `StandardScaler` from sklearn, this method centres the transformed data around a mean of 0.

```python
from PETsARD.Processor.Scaler import Scaler_ZeroCenter

scaler = Scaler_ZeroCenter()
```

## `Scaler_MinMax`: Scale the data to have the range [0, 1]

By applying `MinMaxScaler` from sklearn, this method scales the data to fit within the range [0, 1].

```python
from PETsARD.Processor.Scaler import Scaler_MinMax

scaler = Scaler_MinMax()
```

## `Scaler_Log`: Scale the data by log transformation

This method requires the input data to be positive. It applies log transformation to mitigate the impact of extreme values.

```python
from PETsARD.Processor.Scaler import Scaler_Log

scaler = Scaler_Log()
```
